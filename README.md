Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates that are predictive in determining the direction of future trends. It is an important and common data science task in organisations today. Having prior knowledge of any event can help a company tremendously in the formulation of its goals, policies and planning. However, producing high-quality and reliable forecasts comes with challenges of its own. Forecasting is a complex phenomenon both for humans and for machines. It also requires very experienced time series analysts which as a matter of fact are quite rare.

Prophet is a tool that has been built to address these issues and provides a practical approach to forecasting "at scale". It intends to automate the common features of business time series by providing simple and tunable methods. Prophet enables the analysts with a variety of backgrounds to make more forecasts than they can do manually.
